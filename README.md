# reseacue

A reSEAcue mission

The project uses FVM to manage the version of the flutter

For package installation - `fvm flutter pub-get`
To run the project - `fvm flutter run`

The sprite sheet used right now, is created/distributed by Kenney (www.kenney.nl)

Rules:

1. The generated `.tmx` using `Tiled` software, generates a `<tile>.tsx` file and `<map>.tmx` file. So replace the `tileset` tag in `<map>.tmx` with the one you find in the `<tile>.tsx` file.
